At this point the Par Detectibility as been selected as the perceptual model of choice.
In this chapter, the literature will be reviewed in order to find a suitable sound zone approach for integrating the Par Detectibility.
\begin{itemize}
    \item I will define the criteria that are required for a sound zone algorithm.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item I am yet to think of any.
        \end{itemize}
    \item I will discuss my literature review into sound zones.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Pressure Matching (PM) Approaches.
            \item Acoustic Contrast Control (ACC) Approaches.
            \item Mode Matching Approaches.
            \item The work by Tae-Woong Lee.
        \end{itemize}
    \item I will summarize the results and reflect on the requirements.
        From this I will conclude that the pressure matching approach is the most suited.
\end{itemize}
