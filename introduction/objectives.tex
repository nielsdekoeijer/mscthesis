\section{Objectives and Organization}
\label{ch:introduction:objectives}
This section will state the goals of the thesis and organization of the rest of this document.

This thesis seeks to answer two research questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Research Question 1:} {\textit{``How can models of human auditory perception be included in sound zone algorithms?''}}
    \item \textbf{Research Question 2:} {\textit{``What are the benefits of including models of human auditory perception in sound zone algorithms?''}}
\end{itemize}

What follows is how these research questions will be answered, alongside the structure of the rest of this document.

\subsection{Answering Research Question 1}
The first research question, 

\begin{center}
    {\textit{``How can models of human auditory perception be included in sound~zone~algorithms?''}}
\end{center}

will be answered in \autoref{ch:perceptual}, \autoref{ch:sound_zone}, and \autoref{ch:perceptual_sound_zone}.
These chapters will document the design of a perceptual sound zone algorithm.
The chapters are structured as follows.
\begin{itemize}
    \item First, in \autoref{ch:perceptual}
    \item Next, in \autoref{ch:sound_zone}
    \item Finally, in \autoref{ch:perceptual_sound_zone}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Answering Research Question 2}
The second research question, 

\begin{center}
    {\textit{``What are the benefits of including models of human auditory perception in sound~zone~algorithms?''}}
\end{center}

will be answered in \autoref{ch:results}.
This will be done by comparing the perceptual sound zone algorithm from Research Question 1 with a reference sound zone algorithm.
The chapter is structured as follows.
