\section{Objectives and Organization}
\label{ch:introduction:objectives}
This section will state the goals of the thesis and organization of the rest of this document.
Als stated in the motivation, the goal of the thesis is to construct a perceptual sound zone algorithm.
The central question in this thesis is: 

{\centering\textit{``How can perceptual models of the human auditory system be used to improve sound zone algorithms?''}}

This question is answered in three steps. 
First, a perceptual model is selected in \autoref{ch:perceptual}.
Next, a sound zone algorithm is selected in \autoref{ch:sound_zone}.
Finally, the two are combined and the resulting algorithm is evaluated in \autoref{ch:perceptual_sound_zone}.
The organization of the three chapters is given below.

\subsection{Search and Implementation of a Perceptual Model}
\label{ch:introduction:objectives:perceptual}
The goal of \autoref{ch:perceptual} is to find a perceptual model suitable for use in a perceptual sound zone algorithm.
This chapter starts with a summary of necessary psycho-acoustics background in \autoref{ch:perceptual:background}.

In order to construct a perceptual sound zone algorithm, a perceptual model is required.
In order to discover what perceptual models exist, a literature review into promising state of the art perceptual models 
is given in \autoref{ch:perceptual:review}.

Next, \autoref{ch:perceptual:selection} reflects on what the desirable properties of a perceptual model are for
the design of perceptual sound zone algorithm.
These criteria are then used in the selection of one of the perceptual models from the literature review is given in \autoref{ch:perceptual:selection}.
The selected perceptual model is then discussed in greater detail in \autoref{ch:perceptual:implementation}, concluding the chapter. 

\subsection{Search and Implementation of a Sound Zone Approach}
\label{ch:introduction:objectives:sound_zone}
Next, \autoref{ch:sound_zone} will document the search of a sound zone algorithm that is suitable for the selected perceptual model.

To this end, a literature review is performed in \autoref{ch:sound_zone:approach_review} to document what sound zone approaches exist.
Using this review, \autoref{ch:sound_zone:approach_selection} will reflect on the selected perceptual model to select one of the 
reviewed approaches.

The implementation of the selected sound zone approach is then given by first formalizing the sound zone problem mathematically in 
\autoref{ch:sound_zone:data_model}, giving the mathematical framework from which algorithms can be derived.
The framework is then used to give the implementation in \autoref{ch:sound_zone:approach_implementation}.

The following sections \autoref{ch:sound_zone:block_based} and \autoref{ch:sound_zone:frequency_domain_conversion} rewrite the problem slightly to 
prepare for integration with the perceptual model.

The derived sound zone algorithm will form the foundation on which the perceptual sound zone algorithm will be built.
In addition to this, it will serve as a reference implementation with which the perceptual sound zone algorithm
can be compared.
