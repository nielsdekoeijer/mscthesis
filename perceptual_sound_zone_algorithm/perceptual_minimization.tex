Previously, \autoref{ch:sound_zone:approach_selection} noted that the pressure matching approach could be formulated using the detectability.
In this section, this approach is used to propose two sound zone algorithms.

In the proposed approach, rather than optimizing the sum reproduction errors $\text{RE}^{(m)}_\zz$ and leakage errors $\text{LE}^{(m)}_\zz$, it is proposed to instead use the reproduction error detectability $\text{RED}^{(m)}_\zz$ and the leakage error detectability $\text{LED}^{(m)}_\zz$ respectively.
These can be understood to be perceptual alternatives to $\text{RE}^{(m)}_\zz$ and $\text{LE}^{(m)}_\zz$.

In \autoref{ch:sound_zone:approach_selection} the description of reproduction error detectability $\text{RED}^{(m)}_\zz$ and the leakage error detectability $\text{LED}^{(m)}_\zz$ is given in terms of full-length input sequences.
As noted, this is inaccurate as the detectability operates on a short-time scale and is only done this way to convey the concept. 

Henceforth, using the concepts introduced in \autoref{ch:perceptual_sound_zone:stft}, let $\text{RED}^{(m)}_\zz[\mu]$ and $\text{LED}^{(m)}_\zz[\mu]$ denote the reproduction error detectability and leakage error detectability corresponding to block $\mu$ in control point $m$. 

To define these error detectability quantities, recall that detectability is defined as follows: 
\begin{equation}
    D(x[n],\,\varepsilon[n]) = \norm[2][2]{W_x[k]\mathcal{E}[k]} 
\end{equation}
Using this definition alongside the short-time frequency domain definitions given in \autoref{ch:perceptual_sound_zone:stft}, the definition of the reproduction error detectability $\text{RED}^{(m)}_\zz$ and the leakage error detectability $\text{LED}^{(m)}_\zz$ can be given as follows:
\begin{align}
    &\begin{aligned}
        \text{RED}^{(m)}_\zz[\mu] &= D(\tilde{t}^{(m)}[n, \mu],\,\tilde{p}_\zz^{(m)}[n, \mu] - \tilde{t}^{(m)}[n, \mu]) \\
                       &= \norm[2][2]{W_{\tilde{t}^{(m)}[\mu]}[k]
                            \left(\tilde{P}_\zz^{(m)}[k, \mu] - \tilde{T}^{(m)}[k, \mu]\right)},
    \end{aligned}\\
    &\begin{aligned}
        \text{LED}^{(m)}_\zz[\mu] &= D(\tilde{t}^{(m)}[n, \mu],\,\tilde{p}_\zz^{(m)}[n, \mu]) \\
                       &= \norm[2][2]{W_{\tilde{t}^{(m)}[\mu]}[k]
                            \left(\tilde{P}_\zz^{(m)}[k, \mu]\right)}.
    \end{aligned}
\end{align}
Here, $W_{\tilde{t}^{(m)}[\mu]}[k]$ can be understood as the perceptual weighting informed by the masking properties of the frequency domain target $\tilde{t}^{(m)}[n, \mu]$.

What follows is the proposal of two perceptual sound zone algorithms using the proposed error detectabilities.

\subsection{Proposal of Unconstrained Perceptual Pressure Matching}
\label{ch:perceptual_sound_zone:perceptual_minimization:unconstrained}
This section proposes an algorithm that minimizes the detectability of the total error.
This is similar to the pressure matching approach introduced in \autoref{ch:sound_zone:approaches}, 
in which the total error is minimized.

Consider the following optimization problem:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    \argmin{\tilde{x}_\za^{(l)}[n,\mu],\,\tilde{x}_\zb^{(l)}[n,\mu]\,\forall\,l}{
       & \sum_{m\in A}\text{RED}_\za^{(m)}[\mu] + \sum_{m\in B}\text{LED}_\za^{(m)}[\mu] +\\
       & \sum_{m\in B}\text{RED}_\zb^{(m)}[\mu] + \sum_{m\in A}\text{LED}_\zb^{(m)}[\mu]
    }.
    \end{aligned}
    \label{eq:perceptual_unconstrained}
\end{equation}
The total detectability of the reproduction errors and the leakage errors is minimized by optimizing over the 
block-based representations of the loudspeaker input signals $\tilde{x}_\za^{(l)}[n,\mu]$ and $\tilde{x}_\zb^{(l)}[n,\mu]$.
The expected behavior of this optimization problem is that the sound pressure errors will be shaped in such a way that they are masked by the target sound pressure.

\subsection{Proposal of Constrained Perceptual Pressure Matching}
\label{ch:perceptual_sound_zone:perceptual_minimization:constrained}
The previously discussed approach minimizes the total detectability.
In this section, a perceptual sound zone algorithm is proposed that introduces constraints to the problem. 

The motivation for this approach is that it is hypothesized that the Par distortion detectability has a consistent perceptual interpretation.
As mentioned in \autoref{ch:perceptual:implementation}, a detectability of 1 will consistently imply ``just noticeable''~\cite{van2005perceptual}.

This makes choosing constraints for detectability easier than typical non-perceptual pressure matching approaches.
These approaches typically directly constrain the sound pressure error, for which it is difficult to determine constraints~\cite{shi2021generation} as the sound pressure error does not have a consistent perceptual interpretation.
As a result, a sound pressure error constraint can lead to widely varying results perceptually.

This motivates the proposal of a perceptually constrained sound pressure approach.
In this approach, the reproduction error detectability will be constrained, while the leakage error detectability will be minimized.
To this end, the following optimization problem is defined:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    \argmin{\tilde{x}_\za^{(l)}[n,\mu],\,\tilde{x}_\zb^{(l)}[n,\mu]\,\forall\,l}{
       & \sum_{m\in B}\text{LED}_\za^{(m)}[\mu] + \sum_{m\in A}\text{LED}_\zb^{(m)}[\mu]},\\
        \subjectto {& \text{RED}_\za^{(m)}[\mu] \leq D_0 \quad\forall\, m\in A\\
                    & \text{RED}_\zb^{(m)}[\mu] \leq D_0 \quad\forall\, m\in B}.
    \end{aligned}
    \label{eq:perceptual_constrained}
\end{equation}
Here, $D_0$ is the maximum allowed detectability of the reproduction error per control point $m$.
The intended effect of this constraint is limiting how detectable the deviation of the achieved sound pressure is from the specified target.
Effectively, this allows for controlling the quality of the achieved sound pressure per control point $m$. 
To the knowledge of the authors, this is a novelty.

It is also hypothesized that the constraint $D_0$ allows for more control over the trade-off between reproduction error detectability and leakage error detectability.

It should be noted that constraining the leakage error detectability is also a good choice.
In doing so the algorithm is limited in the amount of interference that it allows. 
A possible optimization problem that achieves this is defined as follows: 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    \argmin{\tilde{x}_\za^{(l)}[n,\mu],\,\tilde{x}_\zb^{(l)}[n,\mu]\,\forall\,l}{
       & \sum_{m\in B}\text{RED}_\za^{(m)}[\mu] + \sum_{m\in A}\text{RED}_\zb^{(m)}[\mu]},\\
        \subjectto {& \text{LED}_\zb^{(m)}[\mu] \leq D_0 \quad\forall\, m\in A\\
                    & \text{LED}_\za^{(m)}[\mu] \leq D_0 \quad\forall\, m\in B}.
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
This problem is not pursued any further in this thesis.
Constraining the detectability of the leakage error is, however, found to be promising future work, which is discussed further in \autoref{ch:conclusion}.
