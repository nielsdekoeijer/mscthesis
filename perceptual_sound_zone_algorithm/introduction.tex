In \autoref{ch:perceptual} the Par detectability is selected as the most promising perceptual model for use in a perceptual sound zone algorithm.
Next, in \autoref{ch:sound_zone} various sound zone algorithms are discussed, ultimately leading to the proposal of a perceptual sound zone framework in \autoref{ch:sound_zone:approach_selection} that uses the Par detectability measure in the creation of sound zones.

This chapter uses the proposed perceptual sound zone framework to propose and implement two perceptual sound zone algorithms.

\subsection*{Chapter Structure}
This chapter is structured as follows.
\begin{itemize}
    \item First, \autoref{ch:perceptual_sound_zone:stft} discusses the reformulation of the time-domain pressure matching approach given in \autoref{ch:sound_zone:approaches} to a short-time frequency-domain pressure matching approach.
    This is necessary for the perceptual framework discussed in \autoref{ch:sound_zone:approach_selection} to be implementable.
    \item Next, \autoref{ch:perceptual_sound_zone:perceptual_minimization} discusses the framework implementation of the framework proposed in \autoref{ch:sound_zone:approach_selection}. This is then subsequently used to formulate two perceptual sound zone algorithms.
\end{itemize}
