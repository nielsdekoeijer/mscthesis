This chapter seeks to combine the selected perceptual model and the selected sound zone algorithm.
In \autoref{ch:perceptual}, it was found that the Par detectability was best suited.

Based on the constraints posed by this perceptual model, \autoref{ch:sound_zone} found that a pressure matching approach was 
best suited.
The chapter concluded with the implementation of a multi-zone pressure matching algorithm that can be used as a foundation
to build the perceptual algorithm on. 

This chapter is structured as follows.
