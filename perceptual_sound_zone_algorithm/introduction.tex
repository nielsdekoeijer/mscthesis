In \autoref{ch:perceptual} the Par detectability is selected as the perceptual for use in a perceptual sound zone algorithm.
Subsequently, in \autoref{ch:sound_zone:approach_selection} an approach is proposed which uses the Par detectability measure in order
to create sound zones.
This chapter discusses the implementation of this proposed approach.

This chapter is structured as follows.
