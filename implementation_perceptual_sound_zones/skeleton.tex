Describes the design of the perceptual sound zone algorithm.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduction of detectability into the various terms of the existing STFT-based Multi-Zone Pressure-Matching
        approach.
    \item Show how these terms can be used to form multiple algorithms
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Unconstrained minimization of detectability 
            \item Constrained minimization of detectability
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Motivate by discussing shortcomings of unconstrained approach
                \end{itemize}
