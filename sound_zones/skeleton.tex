In the preceding chapter it was concluded that a pressure matching approach was best suited for building a perceptual sound zone algorithm.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To form the basis for the perceptual algorithm.
    \item To function as a reference implementation to evaluate performance.
\end{enumerate}

The chapter will discuss the following
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduction of a data model from which the sound zone problem can be stated mathematically.
    \item Derivation of a multi-zone pressure matching approach from the previously introduced mathematical framework. 
    \item Extension of the multi-zone pressure matching to perform on a frame by frame basis.
        This is done in order to allow for real-time sound zones.
\end{itemize}
