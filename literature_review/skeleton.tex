In order to build a perceptual sound zone algorithm, we review literature for both sound zones and perceptual models.
This chapter will also motivate what sound zone techniques and perceptual models will be used in the design of the perceptual sound zone algorithm.
\begin{itemize}
    \item I will discuss my literature review into sound zones.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Pressure Matching Approaches
            \item Acoustic Contrast Approaches
            \item Mode Matching Approaches
        \end{itemize}
    \item I will discuss my literature review into perceptual models.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Dau Model
            \item Detectibility Models, i.e. Par and Taal
            \item Distraction Model
            \item Speech Intelligibility Based, i.e. SIIB and STOI
        \end{itemize}
    \item I will briefly discuss the prior work done on perceptual sound zones.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The work by Tae-Woong Lee.
        \end{itemize}
    \item I will discuss and motivate the chosen sound zone approach (pressure matching) and the chosen perceptual model (detectibility).
\end{itemize}
