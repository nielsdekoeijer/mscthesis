This chapter aims to evaluate the previously derived algorithms by comparing the perceptual algorithms
with the reference algorithm.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduction to the comparison methodology
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Use of STOI
            \item Use of PESQ 
            \item Use of Distraction
        \end{itemize}
    \item Evaluation of reference vs unconstrained problem
    \item Evaluation of reference vs constrained problem for different values of the constraint
\end{itemize}
