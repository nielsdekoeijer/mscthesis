Here, I describe the implementation of the chosen perceptual models, i.e. the detectibility.
\begin{itemize}
    \item I give a high-level description of detectibility. 
        I mention that there are two implementations in literature: Par and Taal.
        I mention the trade-offs between the two.
    \item I describe the Par Detectibility.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The underlying perceptual ideas
            \item How its implemented
            \item How its calibrated
        \end{itemize}
    \item I describe the Taal Detectibility.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The underlying perceptual ideas
            \item How its implemented
            \item How its calibrated
        \end{itemize}
    \item I compare the Par and Taal Detectibility.
    \item I show that my implementations of the Par and Taal Detectibility are valid.
        This is done by comparing the masking curve predictions to a reference implementation of the Dau model.
\end{itemize}
