The goal of this chapter is to find a suitable perceptual algorithm for the creation of a perceptual sound zone algorithm.
This chapter is structured as follows.

The chapter will begin in \autoref{ch:perceptual:background} with some background information on the human auditory system.
This is done to ensure that the reader has the knowledge to understand the perceptual aspects of the thesis.

Next, with the necessary psycho-acoustical background in place, a literature review into perceptual models is given in \autoref{ch:perceptual:review}.
The purpose of this review is to document candidates for the perceptual model that will be used in the perceptual sound zone algorithm.
In addition to this, the reviewed models could also serve as potential candidates for use in the evaluation 
of the perceptual sound zone algorithm.

To perform the selection of a perceptual model from the candidates, criteria are be defined in \autoref{ch:perceptual:selection}. 
These criteria reflect desirable properties for a perceptual model to have for integration into sound zone algorithms.
The criteria are then used to make a selection.

Afterwards, the selected perceptual model is discussed in more detail in
\autoref{ch:perceptual:implementation} by stating implementation details and describing its behavior.
The chapter will then wrap up with some conclusions in \autoref{ch:perceptual:conclusion}.
