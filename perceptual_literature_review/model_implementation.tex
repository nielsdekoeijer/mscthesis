The Par distortion detectability is the perceptual model used in the proposed perceptual sound zone framework.
In this section, to give the reader a greater understanding of the model, the Par distortion detectability measure is considered in greater detail.

This section is organized as follows.
First, \autoref{ch:perceptual:implementation:intuition} gives a high-level description of the Par distortion detectability, providing an intuitive understanding and introducing some of the notation that is used.
Next, the steps for computing the distortion detectability are described in 
\autoref{ch:perceptual:implementation:computation}.
Finally, \autoref{ch:perceptual:implementation:least_squares} rewrites the distortion detectability into terms of a squared $L^2$-norm and provides some analysis of the behavior of the resulting representation.

\subsection{High-Level Description of the Par Distortion Detectability}
\label{ch:perceptual:implementation:intuition}
In this section, a high-level description of the Par distortion detectability measure is given.
This is done to give the reader a basic understanding of the model before going into greater detail.

The Par distortion detectability maps two input sequences to a positive real value, i.e. $D: (\Real{N_x}, \Real{N_x})\mapsto \Real{+}$.
The two input sequences are the masking signal $x[n]\in\Real{N_x}$ and the disturbance signal $\varepsilon[n]\in\Real{N_x}$.
The distortion detectability of these two sequences is denoted as $D(x[n], \varepsilon[n])$. 

Imagine a human listening to both the masking signal $x[n]$ and the disturbance signal $\varepsilon[n]$ simultaneously.
The distortion detectability $D(x[n], \varepsilon[n])$ can be understood as how easily a human listener can detect the disturbance signal $\varepsilon[n]$ in presence of the masking signal $x[n]$.
The signal $x[n]$ is referred to as the masking signal because its masking properties are used to determine how well it masks the disturbance signal $\varepsilon[n]$.

For this interpretation to be accurate, the signals $x[n]$ and $\varepsilon[n]$ should be short-time signals.
The paper uses a signal length of 20 to 200 milliseconds~\cite{van2005perceptual}.    
This is important, as the model assumes that the psycho-acoustical properties of $x[n]$ and $\varepsilon[n]$ are stationary.  

The measure is normalized in such a way that the distortion detectability $D(x[n],\varepsilon[n])$ is equal to 1 when the disturbance signal $\varepsilon[n]$ is ``just noticeable'' in presence of masking signal $x[n]$.
That is to say: if the distortion detectability is 1, the disturbance is on the verge of being noticeable and not noticeable.

The distortion detectability $D(x[n],\varepsilon[n])$ can also attain a value larger than $1$.
The larger values of the distortion detectability correspond with an increased perceived presence of the disturbance signal $\varepsilon[n]$.

\subsection{Computation Details of the Par Distortion Detectability}
\label{ch:perceptual:implementation:computation}
This section explores calculating the Par distortion detectability.k
The first thing to note about the Par distortion detectability is that it is computed using the frequency domain representations of its inputs~\cite{van2005perceptual}. 
To this end, let $X[k]$ and $\mathcal{E}[k]$ denote the frequency domain representations of the masking signal $x[n]$ and 
the disturbance signal $\varepsilon[n]$ respectively.

After determining the frequency domain representations, 
the Par distortion detectability computes an internal representation of the input signals $X[k]$ and $\mathcal{E}[k]$.
This internal representation models how the input stimuli appear to the human auditory system.
For the Par distortion detectability measure, this is modeled by filtering the input stimuli.

Two subsequent filters are applied.
The first filter models how parts of the ear filter the incoming sound with an outer- and middle-ear filter $H_\text{om}[k]$. 
Next, a $4^\text{th}$ order Gammatone filter bank is applied, modeling the frequency-place transform that occurs in 
basilar membrane inside of the ear~\cite{van2005perceptual}.

The Gammatone filter bank consists of $N_g$ filters.
The frequency-domain representation of each individual filter is denoted by $\Gamma_i[k]$, for $1 \leq i \leq N_g$. 
The filters in the filter bank $\Gamma_i[k]$ have a bandwidth given by the equivalent 
rectangular bandwidth (ERB) and center frequencies are given by the corresponding equivalent rectangular bandwidth number
scale (ERBS).
Expressions for the gammatone filters $\Gamma_i[k]$ are provided by the original paper~\cite{van2005perceptual}.

After filtering, the power per Gammatone filter tap is computed.
Let $M_i$ and $S_i$ denote the output power of the $i^\text{th}$ filter tap for the masking signal $X[k]$ and 
the disturbance signal $\mathcal{E}[k]$ respectively.
This output power can be understood as the amount of power perceived per frequency band of the human ear. 
The relationship between the input quantities and the output power of the filter taps can be given as follows:
\begin{align}
    M_i &= \frac{1}{N_x}\sum_{k=0}^{N_x-1}\left|H_\text{om}[k]\right|^2\left|\Gamma_i[k]\right|^2\left|X[k]\right|^2, \\
    S_i &= \frac{1}{N_x}\sum_{k=0}^{N_x-1}\left|H_\text{om}[k]\right|^2\left|\Gamma_i[k]\right|^2\left|\mathcal{E}[k]\right|^2. 
\end{align}
The output powers can then be used to define the within-channel distortion detectability $D_i$ per filter tap $i$.
This can be thought of the distortion detectability per frequency band of the human ear, and is defined as follows:
\begin{align}
    D_i = \frac{N_xS_i}{N_xM_i + C_a}.
\end{align}
Here, $C_a$ is a calibration constant that ensures that the absolute threshold of hearing is predicted correctly.
This can be understood by considering the case where no masking signal $x[n]$ is present, 
in which case $M_i = 0$ for all $i$.
If not for the calibration constant $C_a$, the distortion detectability of any non-zero disturbance
$\varepsilon[n]$ would be infinite.
In order to take the frequency-dependence of the threshold of hearing into account, the previously described outer- and middle ear filters are defined as the inverse of the threshold of hearing~\cite{van2005perceptual}.

The distortion detectability $D(x[n],\varepsilon[n])$ can then be computed as the scaled sum of all 
within channel distortion detectabilities.
It is defined as follows:
\begin{align}
    D(x[n],\varepsilon[n]) &= C_s L_\text{eff}\sum_{i=0}^{N_g} D_i \\
                        &= C_s L_\text{eff}\sum_{i=0}^{N_g} 
                        \frac{\sum_{k=0}^{N_x-1}\left|H_\text{om}[k]\right|^2\left|
                            \Gamma_i[k]\right|^2\left|\mathcal{E}[k]\right|^2}
                        {\sum_{k=0}^{N_x-1}\left|H_\text{om}[k]\right|^2\left|
                            \Gamma_i[k]\right|^2\left|X[k]\right|^2 + C_a}.
    \label{eq:perceptual:implementation:computation:detectability}
\end{align}
Here, $C_s$ is a calibration constant chosen such that a just noticeable disturbance signal results in a 
detectability of $D(x[n],\varepsilon[n]) = 1$. 
The constant $L_\text{eff}$ is the integration time of the human auditory system.
It is chosen equal to the segment length of $x[n]$ and $\varepsilon[n]$ in milliseconds.  

In order to further understand distortion detectability, consider the behavior of the expression of the 
detectability $D(x[n],\varepsilon[n])$ above.
Imagine that the spectrum of the masking signal is much larger than the disturbance signal, 
i.e. $X[k] \gg \mathcal{E}[k]$ for all frequency bins $k$.
In this case, the detectability of $\varepsilon[n]$ will be small due to the masking of the masking signal $x[n]$ or
due to the threshold of hearing (determined by the calibration constant $C_a$).

Conversely, consider the case that the spectrum of the masking signal is much smaller than the disturbance signal,
i.e. $X[k] \ll \mathcal{E}[k]$ for all frequency bins $k$.
In this case, the resulting detectability is determined greatly by the calibration coefficient~$C_a$: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item If the total energy of the filtered disturbance signal is much larger than the calibration constant 
        $S_i \gg C_a$ for all $i$, the distortion detectability becomes large.
        This models the case that the disturbance signal is large relative to the threshold of hearing.
    \item Alternatively, if $S_i \ll C_a$ for all $i$, the disturbance signal is inaudible due to the threshold of hearing, and the distortion detectability will be low accordingly.
\end{itemize}

The determination of the calibration constants $C_a$ and $C_s$ is discussed in \autoref{ch:perceptual:implementation:calibration}.


\subsection{Least-Squares Formulation of the Par Distortion Detectability}
\label{ch:perceptual:implementation:least_squares}
This section will rewrite the previously introduced detectability into a least-squares representation~\cite{taal2012low}. 
This representation is more mathematically tractable than 
\autoref{eq:perceptual:implementation:computation:detectability} and thus 
will allow for easier integration into existing sound zone algorithms.

To obtain this expression, the sum of squares will be expressed as a $L^2$ norm.
Consider the following rewrite of the detectability given in 
\autoref{eq:perceptual:implementation:computation:detectability}: 
\begin{align*}
    D(x[n],\varepsilon[n]) &= C_s L_\text{eff}\sum_{i=0}^{N_g}
                        \frac{\sum_{k=0}^{N_x-1}\left|H_\text{om}[k]\right|^2\left|
                            \Gamma_i[k]\right|^2\left|\mathcal{E}[k]\right|^2}
                        {\sum_{k=0}^{N_x-1}\left|H_\text{om}[k]\right|^2\left|
                            \Gamma_i[k]\right|^2\left|X[k]\right|^2 + C_a} \\
                           &= \sum_{i=0}^{N_g}
                           \left(\frac{C_s L_\text{eff}}{\norm[2][2]{H_\text{om}[k]\Gamma_i[k]X[k]} + C_a}\right)
                        \sum_{k=0}^{N_x-1}\left|H_\text{om}[k]\right|^2\left|
                        \Gamma_i[k]\right|^2\left|\mathcal{E}[k]\right|^2 \\
                           &= \sum_{k=0}^{N_x-1}\left(\sum_{i=0}^{N_g}
                            \frac{C_s L_\text{eff}\left|\Gamma_i[k]\right|^2}
                                 {\norm[2][2]{H_\text{om}[k]\Gamma_i[k]X[k]} + C_a}\right)
                        \left|H_\text{om}[k]\right|^2\left|\mathcal{E}[k]\right|^2 \\
                           &= \sum_{k=0}^{N_x-1}\left|W_x[k]\right|^2\left|\mathcal{E}[k]\right|^2 \\
                           &= \norm[2][2]{W_x[k]\mathcal{E}[k]}. 
\end{align*}
In this case, the norm is taken over the frequency-domain sequence indexed by $k$.
The rewrite above introduced perceptual weighting $W_x[k]\in\Real{N_x}$ informed by the auditory masking effects of the masking signal $x[n]$. 
The entries of the perceptual weighting can be understood as the importance of those frequencies for the total detectability.
The perceptual weighting $W_x[k]$ is defined as follows: 
\begin{equation}
    W_x[k] = \left(\sqrt{\sum_{i=0}^{N_g}\frac{C_s L_\text{eff}\left|\Gamma_i[k]\right|^2}
        {\norm[2][2]{H_\text{om}[k]\Gamma_i[k]X[k]} + C_a}}\right)
        \left|H_\text{om}[k]\right|.
\end{equation}
Note from this formulation that the perceptual weighting is only a function of the masking signal $x[n]$.

Note also that the resulting detectability $D(x[n],\varepsilon[n])$ is a convex function 
of the disturbance signal $\varepsilon[n]$. 
This can be seen as follows.
The frequency-domain representation $\mathcal{E}[k]$ is related to the 
time-domain representation $\varepsilon[n]$ through the DFT, which is a linear operator.
The perceptual weighting of $\mathcal{E}[k]$ performed by $W_x[k]$ is also a linear operation.
As such, $W_x[k]\mathcal{E}[k]$ is an affine function of $\varepsilon[n]$.
Finally, as the composition of an affine mapping and a convex function is convex~\cite{boyd2004convex},
the Par detectability distortion
is convex in $\varepsilon[n]$.

In order to gain a deeper understanding of the behavior of the perceptual weighting $W_x[k]$, consider 
\autoref{fig:perceptual:implementation:least_squares:masking_expl}.
The figure relates the auditory masking threshold and the corresponding perceptual weighting when a 1000 Hz tone at 70 dB SPL is used as masking signal $x[n]$.
The top plot depicts the masking threshold, and the bottom plot depicts the corresponding perceptual weighting.

Recall that the masking threshold is the minimal sound pressure level that is required for an additional stimulus to be audible in the presence of the masking signal~\cite{painter2000perceptual}.
In addition to this, the threshold of hearing is also depicted to highlight the additional masking that occurs due to the masking signal.

As can be seen, the masking threshold peaks at 52 dB SPL at 1000 Hz.
This implies that a different tone at the same frequency must be at least 52 dB SPL to be audible.
As depicted, this results in a low perceptual weighting at 1000 Hz, implying that a disturbance at this frequency is less detectable.
Note also that the low and higher frequencies are also weighted lower due to the threshold of hearing.
This implies that these frequencies are less important perceptually.
