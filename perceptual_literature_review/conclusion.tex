The goal of this chapter was to determine a suitable perceptual model for integration into a sound zone algorithm.
This was done by first reviewing various objective quality measures and perceptual models from audio coding.

To select a suitable model, the mathematical tractability and the additional computational overhead of each model under
review was considered.
From this, it was found that the Par detectability was found to be the most promising perceptual model included in the
review.
Finally, the chapter concluded with an analysis and implementation of the Par detectability.
