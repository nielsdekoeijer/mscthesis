In the field of psycho-acoustics significant research has been done in characterizing the auditory 
perception and time-frequency
analysis capabilities of the human ear~\cite{painter2000perceptual}.
From this understanding, several perceptual models have been proposed which aim to model the 
perception of auditory stimuli by humans~\cite{van2005perceptual}.

Perceptual models are employed for various purposes.
Objective audio quality measures, for example, are perceptual models which aim to predict the perceived quality of audio~\cite{torcoli2021objective}.
In another example, perceptual audio coding uses models of auditory perception to minimize the perceived artifacts introduced when
performing the compression of audio~\cite{herre2019psychoacoustic}.

In general, many perceptual models operate on a time-frequency internal-ear representation of the input stimuli, obtained by applying an analysis filter bank. 
Among other effects, the filtering performed by the human ear is often taken 
into account at this stage~\cite{van2005perceptual, taal2012low}.
This representation is then used to determine its perceptually relevant aspects 
of the input stimuli~\cite{herre2019psychoacoustic}.

One aspect often used in perceptual models are the various auditory masking properties of the 
input stimuli~\cite{herre2019psychoacoustic}.
In general, auditory masking refers to the effects one sound has on the perception of other sounds~\cite{painter2000perceptual}.
In simultaneous masking, for example, one loud tone may overpower a tone of a similar frequency, rendering the 
latter tone inaudible~\cite{painter2000perceptual}.

Another aspect that is often used is the ``threshold of hearing'', which determines the minimum sound pressure level that can be perceived by a human~\cite{herre2019psychoacoustic}.
Combining this principle with the masking properties, one can define the ``masking threshold'' of input stimuli.
This threshold determines the sound pressure level required for other stimuli to be audible to a human observer in the presence of the input stimuli~\cite{painter2000perceptual} and is often used in perceptual 
models~\cite{van2005perceptual, taal2012low}. 
For example, the threshold of hearing is used in perceptual audio coding to 
make the coding artifacts inaudible~\cite{herre2019psychoacoustic}.

This chapter will motivate the use of the ``Par distortion detectability'' as the perceptual model used in perceptual sound zone algorithm framework proposed in \autoref{ch:sound_zone}, which is subsequently used in \autoref{ch:perceptual_sound_zone} to propose two perceptual sound zone algorithms.
In doing so, several other perceptual measures are discussed in detail, some of which are used in \autoref{ch:results} to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms.

The structure of this chapter is given as follows.
\begin{itemize}
    \item This chapter begins with \autoref{ch:perceptual:review} which documents a review of 
        possible candidate perceptual models from literature for use in the perceptual sound zone framework. 
    \item Next, \autoref{ch:perceptual:selection} motivates the selection of one of the reviewed candidates, 
        namely the ``Par distortion detectability'', as the perceptual model for use in the 
        proposed perceptual sound zone framework.
    \item Finally, the implementation and behavior of the ``Par distortion detectability'' is discussed in more detail in 
        \autoref{ch:perceptual:implementation}.
\end{itemize}
