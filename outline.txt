Just writing out my outline because it became too confusing.

Ch 1. Introduction
-> Motivation: 
	1. Describe sound zone problem, note that perceptual approach is promising
-> Research Question:
	1. How can perceptual information improve sound zones?
-> Organization: 
	1. Literature review into possible perceptual models for use in algorithm or for validation.
	2. Discussion of Pressure Matching, a sound zone approach that was found to be easily intratable with the most promising perceptual model.
	3. Implementation and Review of two Perceptual Sound Zone Algorithms

Ch 2. Perceptual Model Selection
-> Perceptual Background
-> Perceptual Model Literature Review
	1. Audio Coding
	2. Objective Measures
-> Selection Criteria:
	1. Good properties for optimization
	2. It's the Par detectability
-> Description of Par detectability

Ch 3. Pressure Matching 
->
