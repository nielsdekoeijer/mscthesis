\section{Introduction}
In the preceding chapter, the Par Detectability~\cite{van2005perceptual} was selected to be the most promising perceptual
model for integration into sound zone algorithms.
Before integrating this perceptual model into sound zone algorithms, it is important to have a complete understanding.
As such, this chapter will discuss and analyse the the Par Detectability in greater detail.
