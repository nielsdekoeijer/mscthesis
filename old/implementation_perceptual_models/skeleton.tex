Here, I describe the implementation of the chosen perceptual models, i.e. the detectability.
\begin{itemize}
    \item I give a high-level description of detectability. 
    \item I describe the Par Detectability.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The underlying perceptual ideas
            \item How its implemented
            \item How its calibrated
        \end{itemize}
        \item I show that my implementations of the Par Detectability is valid.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item This is done by comparing the masking curve predictions to a reference implementation
                    of the Dau model.
            \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
