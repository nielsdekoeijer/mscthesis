\section{Selection of Perceptual Model for use in Sound Zone Algorithm}
\subsection{Criteria for Selecting Perceptual Model}
This section will define desirable criteria for the perceptual model for integration with a sound zone algorithm.
These criteria will be used to select a perceptual model from the models discussed in the literature review.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Mathematical Tractability.}\\
        It is a desirable property for the perceptual model to be easy to include in optimization problems.
        For example, perceptual models that can are differentiable are therefore favoured over optimization problems
        that are non-differentiable.
    \item \textbf{Computational Overhead:}\\
        It is desirable for the inclusion of the perceptual model to add minimal computational load 
        to the sound zone algorithm.
        The additional overhead of the perceptual model should not increased the run time of the sound zone algorithm by many orders of magnitude.
    \item \textbf{Applicable Audio Content:}\\
        Many perceptual models, such as speech intelligibility metrics, are designed for a specific kind of audio content.
        It is preferable that the perceptual model is as general as possible.
\end{enumerate}
