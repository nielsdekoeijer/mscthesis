An initial description of the sound zone problem was given in the introduction.
This section seeks to build on this description in order to provide the necessary background on sound zones to 
understand the rest of this work.

In sound zones, the goal is to control the spatial distribution of sound inside an enclosure.
This is done by controlling the audio that is produced by an array of loudspeakers.
The space inside the enclosure is divided up into multiple zones.
Each zone is assigned target sound pressure that we would like to have reproduced inside of it.
The reproduction is to be done in such a way that there is minimal interference between zones.
To understand this, consider the example given by \autoref{fig:sound_zones:background:content}.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \scalebox{1.0}{\input{tikz/tikz_2D_room_concept_content.tex}}
    \caption{A room is divided into two zones: a red zone and a blue zone.
        Each zone is assigned different content: content A and content B.
        The loudspeakers array that is present in the room is to be controlled by the sound zone algorithm 
        in such a way that the desired content is reproduced.
        As mentioned, this is to be done in a way that results in minimal interference, e.g. it is undesirable
        to be able to hear content B when inside the red zone.}

\end{figure}

An important concept for understanding sound zone literature is the concept of bright zones and dark zones.
Sound zone problems are typically decomposed into multiple subproblems consisting of a bright zone and 
one or more dark zone(s).

The goal of each subproblems is to reproduce a specified target sound pressure in the bright zone while restricting the 
sound pressure in the dark zones(s).
In doing so, the target sound pressure is essentially reproduced locally in the bright zone,
while the sound pressure leaking into the dark zone(s) is kept low.

When the subproblems are combined, the sound zone problem is solved as all target sound pressures 
are reproduced locally in their respective zones.
To ease the understanding of this concept, an example of this decomposition is given in 
\autoref{fig:sound_zones:background:bright_dark_example}.

    \caption{Decomposition of the example given in \autoref{fig:sound_zones:background:content} into 
        two bright-dark zone pairs.
        For the first problem, the goal is to reproduce content A in bright zone A while minimizing 
        the amount of sound pressure in dark zone A.
        Similarly for the second problem: reproduce content B in bright zone B while minimizing the 
        amount of sound pressure in dark zone B.
        Combining the two solutions results in a solution with content reproduced in both zones with 
        minimal interference between zones.}

% \subsection{Sound Zone Approaches}
% \label{ch:sound_zone:problem:solutions}
% With the sound zone problem sufficiently explained, this section will now cover various sound zone approaches.
% These approaches describe a general manner of solving the sound zone problem.

% \subsubsection{Delay and Sum Beamforming}
% One traditional approach to creating sound zones is delay and sum (DS) beamforming~\cite{olik2013comparative}.
% In beamforming an array of loudspeakers is used to focus a ``beam'' of audio.
% This is done using the principals of constructive and destructive interference by playing with slight delays from each loudspeaker in the array (hence, 
% the name ``delay and sum'').
% The beam is constructed through constructive interference, whereas outside of the beam the audio content is partially canceled through destructive interference.

% For sound zone applications, the angle of the beam is chosen such that the target audio is directed towards its respective bright zone.
% Beamforming is somewhat limited for sound zone applications as it limits the spatial control to an angled beam.
% The other sound zone algorithms that will be discussed in this section can be considered a generalization of beamforming, as their framework supports more
% spatial control.

% \subsubsection{Pressure Matching Approach}
% In pressure matching approaches (PM), one attempts to control the output of the loudspeaker array in such a way that resulting sound pressure in the zone 
% matches the specified target sound pressure for that zone.
% While doing so, the PM approach attempts to minimize the sound pressure that results in other zones as to minimize the interference or crosstalk between zones
% ~\cite{olik2013comparative, betlehem2015personal}.

% PM is usually implemented as an optimization problem which minimizes the least-squares error between the target and resulting sound pressures in the bright zone.
% The optimization problem often includes constraints which limit the squared resulting sound pressure in the dark zone(s).
% The minimization of the least-squares error has been done in both the frequency and the time domain.

% \subsubsection{Acoustic Contrast Control Approach}
% The acoustic contrast control (ACC) approach to sound zones attempts to maximize the acoustic contrast between the bright zone and the dark zone for 
% each specified target sound pressure.
% The acoustic contrast is defined as the ratio of the acoustic potential energy of the bright zone and the dark zone.
% Just as with PM, ACC is defined as an optimization problem.

% Typically, ACC is performed in the frequency domain.
% This is done in a narrow band fashion, where the solution computed separately per frequency band ~\cite{olik2013comparative, betlehem2015personal}.
% However, Elliot et al. explored a broadband approach to ACC in 2011 which was further refined by Cai et al in 2014 called broad band acoustic contrast control 
% (BACC)~\cite{elliott2011regularisation, cai2014time}.
% This was done by translating the ACC problem into the time domain rather than the frequency domain.

% ACC approaches typically have good acoustic contrast, but reproduce the target sound pressure less faithfully than PM approaches~\cite{lee2020signal}.
% As such, hybrid approaches such as ACC-PM~\cite{galvez2015time} and BACC-PM~\cite{lee2018unified} have been proposed recently which allow for what is
% essentially a compromise between ACC and PM.
