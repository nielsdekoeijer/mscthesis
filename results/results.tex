In \autoref{ch:perceptual_sound_zone:perceptual_minimization} two perceptual sound zone algorithms were introduced. 
First, an unconstrained perceptual pressure matching approach where the detectability of the sound pressure errors is minimized.
Secondly, a constrained perceptual pressure matching approach which leverages the fact that the detectability has a consistent 
perceptual interpretation to constrain the detectability of the reproduction error.
In order to effectively describe various points in the room, a version of the room given by \autoref{fig:results:methodology:room}
with the various control points numbered is given in \autoref{fig:results:methodology:room_numbered}.

This section will evaluate the results of the performed experiments for both proposed approaches.
To this end, \autoref{ch:results:results:unconstrained_results} the unconstrained perceptual pressure matching approach is evaluated, and 
in \autoref{ch:results:results:constrained_results} is evaluated.

\subsection{Evaluating Unconstrained Perceptual Pressure Matching}
\label{ch:results:results:unconstrained_results}
In this section, the unconstrained perceptual pressure matching algorithm will be evaluated in accordance to the 
approach discussed in \autoref{ch:results:methodology}.
As discussed in \autoref{ch:perceptual_sound_zone:perceptual_minimization}, 
this algorithm minimizes the total detectability of the reproduction and the leakage error.

    Summary of results for the evaluation of the unconstrained perceptual pressure matching approach,

\label{ch:results:results:unconstrained_results}
\end{table}

The results of the experiment are summarized in \autoref{ch:results:results:unconstrained_results}.
This table depicts the mean and standard deviation of the measures taken over all 4 control points and all 12 experiments.
This is done for both the reference short-time pressure matching algorithm given by \autoref{ch:perceptual_sound_zone:stft} and the unconstrained perceptual 
pressure matching algorithm given by \autoref{ch:perceptual_sound_zone:perceptual_minimization}.

Note the following from the results:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Bright Zone Quality Measure:}\\
        The reference sound zone algorithm outperforms the perceptual sound zone algorithm in terms of the Bright Zone PESQ and MSE.
        This implies that the reference algorithm, when disregarding interference, delivers greater quality for the intended speech signal.
    \item \textbf{Total Quality Measures:}\\
        The perceptual sound zone algorithm outperforms the reference sound zone algorithm in terms of all perceptual measure Total PESQ, SIIB, and STOI.
        The reference algorithm outperforms the reference algorithm in terms of the physical metric MSE.
    \item \textbf{Interference Measures:}\\
        The perceptual sound zone algorithm outperforms the reference in terms of the perceptual measure Distraction.
        The reference sound zone algorithm however outperforms in terms of acoustic contrast.
\end{itemize}

This implies that the the perceptual sound zone algorithm makes a better overall perceptual trade-off between producing the target content 
and minimizing the leakage.

\subsubsection*{Analyzing Algorithm Behavior}
\begin{figure}[]
    \centering
    \input{tikz/tikz_masking_effect.tex}
    \caption{Depiction of the wave forms of the target sound pressure and achieved dark zone sound pressure for the 
        unconstrained perceptual pressure matching approach and the reference pressure matching approach.}
        \label{fig:results:evaluation:unconstrained_results:behavior}
\end{figure}

In the preceding section the reference and perceptual algorithms are compared quantitatively.
In doing so, it is shown that the perceptual algorithm outperforms the reference in terms of total PESQ and Distraction.
This section considers the behavior of the algorithms in an attempt to explain these results.

To this end, consider \autoref{fig:results:evaluation:unconstrained_results:behavior}.
This figure contains a plot of the wave forms of the target sound pressure and achieved dark-zone sound pressure for both the perceptual and non-perceptual
variants of pressure matching for control point $m=2$ (see: \autoref{fig:results:methodology:room_numbered} from the experiments.

The selected control point is in zone $\za$. 
As explained in \autoref{ch:results:methodology}, the achieved dark-zone sound pressure can be understood as the interference due to the other zone, zone $\zb$.

Consider the highlighted region for the reference algorithm.
As can be seen, the interference is a at a relatively constant level.
When compared to the highlighted region for the perceptual algorithm, it can be seen that the magnitude of the interference is correlated to the
magnitude of the target sound pressure for zone $\za$.

When determining the interference for control point $m=2$, the perceptual algorithm takes the target sound pressure for $\za$ into account. 
Effectively, when the target sound pressure is relatively loud, more interference is allowed as it is masked to a degree by the target sound pressure.
