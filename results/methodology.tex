This section discusses the general approach for evaluation of the perceptual sound zone algorithms proposed in 
\autoref{ch:perceptual_sound_zone:perceptual_minimization:unconstrained} and \autoref{ch:perceptual_sound_zone:perceptual_minimization:constrained}.
All algorithms will be evaluated on the basis of simulations. 
As all derived algorithms were found to be computationally intensive, many of the parameter considerations 
for the simulations are chosen such that the computational load is kept feasible.

For the evaluation, the constrained and unconstrained perceptual pressure matching are compared to the 
short-time frequency-domain pressure matching approach
given in \autoref{ch:perceptual_sound_zone:stft} by \autoref{eq:perceptual_sound_zone:stft:stft_pm}.

\subsection{Simulation Configuration}
\label{ch:results:methodology:configuration}
All sound zone algorithms are evaluated in a simulated square room of 5 by 5 meters, with a ceiling height of 3.4 meters.
There are two zones each consisting of two control points.
In order to obtain a sufficiently challenging problem, the zones are placed in close proximity to each other, 
with the two closest points being 0.5 meters apart.
This is important, as a trivial problem makes it difficult to highlight the differences in performance
between the perceptual and non-perceptual approaches.

The room contains 4 loudspeakers placed in the corners of the room at a height of 1.2 meters.
Omnidirectional loudspeakers, which radiate energy equally in all directions~\cite{habets2006room}, are used.
An image depicting the entire setup is given in \autoref{fig:results:methodology:room}.

    \label{fig:results:methodology:room}
\end{figure}

In order to synthesize room impulse responses used to relate the loudspeaker inputs and the resulting sound pressure 
in the control points, the image source method~\cite{allen1979image} is used.
The Habets implementation of the image source method is used~\cite{habets2006room}.

For reasons of computational complexity, the simulated room impulse 
responses is limited to reverberation times of at most 200 milliseconds.
The definition of the reverberation time is the time required for the intensity of reflections to reduce 60 dB relative 
to the direct path sound pressure~\cite{habets2006room}. 
To put the reverberation time used in the experiment into context, 
it has been found in a investigation into the reverberation time of furnished rooms
that similarly sized rooms have an average maximal reverberation 
time of 720 milliseconds~\cite{diaz2005reverberation}.

To define the target sound pressure, content must be selected for the two zones.
For this evaluation, english speech content is used.
The motivation for this is that the objective speech quality measures described in 
\autoref{ch:perceptual} are found to be more robust than
the discussed general audio quality measures.
Another practical reason is that many general audio quality measures have 
little to no free and openly available implementations, whereas the speech measures do.

The speech signals are down sampled to 8000 Hz.
The motivation for this is that it is computationally intensive to run the algorithms at higher sampling rate.
Another motivation is that the majority of the speech energy is contained between 150 and 4000 Hz.

In total, a dataset of 4 loudness-matched speech signals is used for evaluation.
For each experiment, one speech signal is assigned to each zone.
All possible combinations of the speech signals are formed, resulting in a total of 12 possible configurations.
However, due to the symmetry of the the loudspeaker, room, and zones given by \autoref{fig:results:methodology:room} this simplifies to 
a total of 6 configurations.

\subsection{Simulation Evaluation Measures}
\label{ch:results:methodology:measures}
This section introduces the measures that are used to evaluate the simulation results 
of the reference and perceptual algorithms.

The perceptual measures PESQ, STOI, SIIB, and Distraction 
from the literature review discussed in \autoref{ch:perceptual:review} are used for the evaluation.
In addition to these perceptual measures, two traditional physical measures, namely the ``normalized mean square error'' (NMSE) and
the ``acoustic contrast'' (AC) in terms of sound pressure are used in the evaluation of 
sound zone algorithms~\cite{lee2018unified} are also used.

The motivation for including physical measures is to test the hypothesis that, 
while typically outperforming in terms of perceptual measures, the perceptual sound zone algorithms likely do not 
outperform the reference sound zone algorithm in terms of physical measures.
The hypothesis for this for this is that the reference pressure matching approach optimizes over a physical error measure.

A brief summary is given of the outputs and inputs of the sound zone algorithm is given below.
These serve as the inputs to the evaluation measures.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Target Sound Pressure $t^{(m)}$:}\\
        The desired sound pressure per control point $m$, defined by the speech signals 
        corresponding to the zone $\zz$ the control point is in.
    \item \textbf{Achieved Sound Pressure $p_\zz^{(m)}$:}\\
        The sound pressure achieved by the algorithm at control point control point $m$ for a zone $\zz$.
        This sound pressure has two different interpretations, depending on the control point under consideration.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Achieved Bright Zone Sound Pressure for Zone $\zz$:}\\
                When $m \in Z$, the achieved sound pressure is the achieved approximation of the 
                target sound pressure $t^{(m)}$ for control point $m$.
                This can be understood as the approximation of the target sound pressure for a control point $m$, sans leakage or interference. 
            \item \textbf{Achieved Dark Zone Sound Pressure for Zone $\zz$:}\\
                When $m \notin Z$, the achieved sound pressure represents the sound pressure 
                that arises other zones due to reproducing the bright zone for zone $\zz$. 
                It can be understood as the leakage or interference in other zones due to reproducing zone~$\zz$.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Total Achieved Sound Pressure $\sum_\zz p_\zz^{(m)}$:}\\
        The sound pressure in a control point $m$ due to contributions of all zones $\zz$.
        This represents the sound pressure that a user of the sound zone system would experience,
        and thus it contains both the approximation of the target sound pressure and the interference.
\end{itemize}
For more information on these quantities, the reader is referred to \autoref{ch:sound_zone:data_model}, where they 
are introduced.
What follows is a description of various categories of evaluation measures.

\subsubsection{Perceptual Quality Measures}
The first category of measures that is discussed are perceptual measures that estimate the perceived 
quality of audio.

One of the metrics that is used is the Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ).
As described in \autoref{ch:perceptual:review:objective}, PESQ is a metric which grades the quality of a 
degraded speech signal with respect to a reference speech signal.
The resulting quality grade will be between 0 and 5, where 5 is the highest obtainable grade.

Another set of metrics that will be used are two speech intelligibility metrics: 
the Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI) and 
the Speech Intelligibility in Bits (SIIB).
STOI provides an intelligibility score between 0 and 1, where 1 is the highest score.
SIIB instead scores the intelligibility with an information rate given in bits/s, lower-bounded by 0 bits/s.
A maximum intelligibility corresponds to a rate of about 150 bits/s~\cite{van2017instrumental}.

All perceptual measures evaluate the quality of a ``degraded'' input stimuli with respect to a ''reference'' stimuli.
Using the previously introduced quantities, the measures are to evaluate sound zone performance as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{PESQ, STOI and SIIB of the Total Achieved Sound Pressure with 
        respect to the Target Sound Pressure:}\\
        Corresponds to the quality / intelligibility of the achieved sound pressure,
        including interference, and will be referred 
        to as the \textbf{``total PESQ''}, \textbf{``total STOI''} and the \textbf{``total SIIB''} per control point $m$. 
    \item \textbf{PESQ, STOI and SIIB of the Achieved Bright Zone Sound Pressure with 
        respect to the Target Sound Pressure:}\\
        Corresponds to the quality / intelligibility of the achieved sound pressure sans interference.
        This quantity is referred to as the \textbf{``bright zone PESQ''}, \textbf{``bright zone STOI''} and \textbf{``bright zone SIIB''}
        per control point $m$ for zone~$\zz$.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Perceptual Interference Measure}
Another metric that will be used for evaluation is the Distraction model also introduced in \autoref{ch:perceptual:review:objective}.
This model grades how distracting an interferer is in presence of target audio.
The grade uses a scale from 0 to 100, where 100 is considered maximally distracting.

The distraction will be used as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Distraction of the achieved dark Zone Sound Pressure with respect to the Achieved Bright 
        Zone Sound Pressure:}\\
        This quantifies how distracting the dark zone sound pressures are when listening to the bright zone 
        sound pressure per control point $m$. 
        This will simply be referred to as the \textbf{``Distraction''} per control point $m$.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Physical Measures}
One physical measure is the acoustic contrast (AC) between the 
achieved bright zone sound pressure and the achieved dark zone sound pressure can be used as a non-perceptual measure of interference.
Initially introduced in \autoref{ch:sound_zone:approaches}, 
the acoustic contrast between two time-domain sequences $x[n]\in\Real{N}$
and $y[n]\in\Real{N}$ is given as follows: 
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{AC}(x,y) = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{\norm[2][2]{x[n]}}{\norm[2][2]{y[n]}}\right).
\end{equation}
Another non-perceptual metric that can be used to evaluate the quality of the result is the normalized mean square error (MSE).
The NMSE of the deviation of time sequence $x[n]$ from reference time sequence $y[n]$ is given as:
\begin{equation}
    \text{NMSE}(x,y) = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{\norm[2][2]{y[n] - x[n]}}{\norm[2][2]{y[n]}}\right).
\end{equation}
Note that both physical quantities are given in decibels.

These physical measures are used to evaluate sound zone performance as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{NMSE of the Total Achieved Sound Pressure with respect to the Target Sound Pressure:}\\
        Describes the NMSE between the target and achieved sound pressure, and will be referred to as the 
        \textbf{``total NMSE''}.
    \item \textbf{NMSE of the Achieved Bright Zone Sound Pressure with respect to the Target Sound Pressure:}\\
        This is the NMSE between the target and the achieved sound pressure sans interference, 
        and will henceforth referred to as the \textbf{``bright zone NMSE''} per control point $m$.
    \item \textbf{Acoustic contrast between the Achieved Bright Zone Sound Pressure and the 
        Achieved Dark Zone Sound Pressure:}\\
        Quantifies the ratio of the acoustic potential energy of the bright zone and of the dark zone.
        From here on referred to as the \textbf{``Acoustic Contrast''} per control point $m$.
\end{itemize}
