In the preceding~\autoref{ch:perceptual_sound_zone}, two perceptual sound zone algorithms are proposed based on the proposed framework given in
\autoref{ch:sound_zone:approach_selection}.
This chapter performs an evaluation in order to determine the benefits, if any, of including perceptual information in sound zone algorithms 
in the proposed fashion.

This is done by comparing the proposed algorithms with a reference algorithm.

\subsection*{Chapter Structure}
In order to achieve this goal, this chapter is structured as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item This chapter begins with a description of the evaluation methodology in \autoref{ch:results:methodology}, describing the experiments 
        and the metrics used to evaluate them.
    \item \autoref{ch:results:evaluation} then presents and discusses the results of the described experiments. 
        The proposed algorithms are compared to a reference algorithm through various perceptual metrics in order to determine their relative performance.
\end{itemize}
