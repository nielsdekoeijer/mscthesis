Improvements Mentioned by Martin
0. General
* Captions are descriptive, purely what is shown.
* Refer rather than re-explain
* Different introductions, go to content immediately.

2. Perceptual
* Calibration to appendix
* 2.4.3 Detail taal vs par computational complexity (from paper)
* 2.4.3 GEEF ALS MIJN CONTRIBUTIE
	=> PROPOSED
	=> Begin 2.4.3 of eind 2.4.2 "Previous work was from the paper"
	=> Why is that in important? Why mathematical tractable
	=> 2.4.4 in 2.4.3. NO SUBSUBSUBSECTION
* Taal model WEIGHTING in time domain, but computed in STFT domain.

3. 
* 3.1.1 "The two non-overlapping zones => Relateer cal{A} en cal{B} terug aan de examples in de introduction"
	=> LINK HEEL BELANGERIJk 
* Reverse A and cal{A}?
* 3.3 "In later parts, pressure matching will be used. ACC is only included for completeness"
* 3.4 ACC not chosen as Detectability was shown to convex in the error.
	ALSO ACC works with relative pressures rather than absolute pressures, which is problematic because we use the threshold in quiet.
* analysis of PROPOSED Least squares representation in 3.4.1

4. PSZA
* 4.2: Citation for the overlapping windows => Julius Smith what Martin sent me earlier

5. Evaluation => Results en Analysis of Proposed Perceptual Sound Zone Algorithms
5.1 Homogeen maken plaatjes. 3D plaatjes H3 niet nodig.
5.1 Parameteres for the simulation are such to keep the computational intensity.

* Add waveform discussion
* Define 5.2.3 in terms of the mathematical quantities first, then describe intiuiton

6.
* Discussion

Improvements Mentioned by Jorge
=> JORGE:
* Perceptual formulation is eigenlijk niet mijn contributie: Taal had em al gegeven in een paper.

0. General
* CAS nummer vragen aan Richard, daarna Alle-Jan
* In general, reflect content in titles
* Conclusion title should be more verbose
* In a scientific journal geen tijd. (WILL STATE => IS STATED)
* MORE CONFIDENCE => I state my facts, cite where I found it. People can disagree, thats OK. No need to nuance a priori!
* EVERYTHING THAT ISNT MINE => CITE. Makes it clear what is and isnt mind

1. Introduction

2. Perceptual
* 2.1 Drop "This structured as follows"
* 2.1 => 2.0, add things we exploit ``masking'' and ``threshold of quiet'', add tons of references
* Actually, "2.0 => 2.1", "Perceptual Background". Structure at end
* Drop psycho-acoustical background chapter
* 2.3, tell the reader which measures will be later used. I.e. in 2.3.1 zeggen "deze worden later nog gebruikt"
* 2.3 add more references.
* 2.3 Relationship between the audio coding and objective measures, deeper relationship: model how audio is experienced
* 2.4 title: "Selected Perceptual Model for use in Perceptual Sound Zone Algorithm" PRESENT TIME
* 2.4.3 Mijn contribution over de taal model niet noemen. 
* 2.4.2 and 2.4.3 "Considering", more verbose
* 2.4.4 Convex opmerking wel doen. Kort noemen waarom e en WE convex is.

3. Sound zone
* 3.1 and 3.2 => 3.0, reduce sections
* Actually, "3.0 => 3.1", "Sound Zones Background", Structure at end

4. Perceptual Sound Zones
* 4.1 => 4.0

5. Results
* 5.1 => 5.0

6. Conclusion
* title of chapter should be more verbose
* answers of resesarch questions
* future work
