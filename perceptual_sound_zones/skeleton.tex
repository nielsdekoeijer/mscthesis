Describes the design of the perceptual sound zone algorithm.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduction of detectibility to form perceptual cost function building blocks:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Detectibility of reproduction error
            \item Detectibility of interference
        \end{itemize}
    \item Show how building blocks can be used to form different perceptual algorithms:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Algorithm 1: Minimization of detectibility of reproduction error and detectibility of interference.
            \item Algorithm 2: Minimization of detectibility of reproduction error subject to constraint on detectibility of interference.
            \item Algorithm 3: Minimization of detectibility of interference subject to constraint on detectibility of reproduction error.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Evaluate different algorithms:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Compare Reference and Algorithm 1 in terms of Distraction and PEAQ.
            \item Compare Reference and Algorithm 2 when varying the constraint on the detectibility of the interference in terms of Distraction and PEAQ.
            \item Compare Reference and Algorithm 3 when varying the constraint on the detectibility of the reproduction error in terms of Distraction and PEAQ.
        \end{itemize}
