Improvements Mentioned by Martin
0. General
* Captions are descriptive, purely what is shown.
* Refer rather than re-explain
* Different introductions, go to content immediately.

2. Perceptual
* Calibration to appendix
* 2.4.3 Detail taal vs par computational complexity (from paper)

4. PSZA
* 4.2: Citation for the overlapping windows => Julius Smith what Martin sent me earlier
* 4.2: Cut down the introduction to the block based processing
* 4.2: Careful on the use of H: Use for block size as well as hop size :(
* Merge 4.2 and 4.3 
* Define 5.2.3 in terms of the mathematical quantities first, then describe intiuiton

5. Results
* Add waveform discussion

6.
* Discussion

Improvements Mentioned by Jorge

0. General
* CAS nummer vragen aan Richard, daarna Alle-Jan
* In general, reflect content in titles
* Conclusion title should be more verbose
* In a scientific journal geen tijd. (WILL STATE => IS STATED)
* MORE CONFIDENCE => I state my facts, cite where I found it. People can disagree, thats OK. No need to nuance a priori!
* EVERYTHING THAT ISNT MINE => CITE. Makes it clear what is and isnt mind

1. Introduction

2. Perceptual
* 2.1 Drop "This structured as follows"
* 2.1 => 2.0, add things we exploit ``masking'' and ``threshold of quiet'', add tons of references
* Actually, "2.0 => 2.1", "Perceptual Background". Structure at end
* Drop psycho-acoustical background chapter
* 2.3, tell the reader which measures will be later used. I.e. in 2.3.1 zeggen "deze worden later nog gebruikt"
* 2.3 add more references.
* 2.3 Relationship between the audio coding and objective measures, deeper relationship: model how audio is experienced
* 2.4 title: "Selected Perceptual Model for use in Perceptual Sound Zone Algorithm" PRESENT TIME
* 2.4.3 Mijn contribution over de taal model niet noemen. 
* 2.4.2 and 2.4.3 "Considering", more verbose
* 2.4.4 Convex opmerking wel doen. Kort noemen waarom e en WE convex is.

3. Sound zone
* 3.1 and 3.2 => 3.0, reduce sections
* Actually, "3.0 => 3.1", "Sound Zones Background", Structure at end

4. Perceptual Sound Zones
* 4.1 => 4.0

5. Results
* 5.1 => 5.0

6. Conclusion
* title of chapter should be more verbose
* answers of resesarch questions
* future work
